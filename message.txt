Like in English, changing the sentence structure in Spanish can lead to misunderstandings. We will see later that the typical word order in Spanish is SVO (Subject, Verb, Object), but I have good news for you! Spanish is a very flexible language, and most of the time you’ll be able to change that order without altering the meaning of the sentence or making it completely ungrammatical.

Have a look at the following example:

Mi hermano está leyendo un libro. (My brother is reading a book.)

We have a subject (Mi hermano), a verb form (está leyendo) and an object (un libro).

Now imagine I have gone mad and changed the word order of the sentence, like this:

           Un libro está leyendo mi hermano. (Literally: A book is reading my brother.)

As you can see, the Spanish sentence is still grammatically correct, but the literal translation into English has become a little weird, to say the least
